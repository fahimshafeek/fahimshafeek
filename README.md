## 🎓 About Me
I am currently a student studying for Computer Science and Engineering at SaintGits College of Engineering, Kerala. I am pursuing a career in data science or cybersecurity, whatever the future has in store for me. Engaging in tech talks, and mansplaining is something I consider myself to be quite potent at. New tech and developments always tickles my curiosity and my yearn to know more. A bit of programming knowledge and a good general knowledge about various technical terminologies across a vast field are some of my plus points. My hobbies cover a bizarre spectrum of things: everything from fiddling with tech, doomscrolling through gadget catalogues, to cycling, driving, motorsports, to music, anime, etc. the list goes on.
